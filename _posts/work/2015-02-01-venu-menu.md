#Project 2 - Venu Menu Group Project

- [Venu Menu](https://venu-menu.herokuapp.com/login)
- [Venu Menu on GitHub](https://github.com/cagedcrown/venu-menu)

## Overview
For week nine of the Web Development Immersive course, we were all told to write an idea for a group project that we would like to do.
Then we were split into groups of 4 and told to pick one of our classmates ideas that were not our own.

## Original Idea
Use an API that a user will be able to see local concerts (U St. Music Hall, Lincoln Theater, etc.) and create a list of shows they're interested in.
Then integrating a music API a user will also be able to listen to the performing artists most popular songs without being rerouted to another site.

## Our Version
We were only given 4 days to accomplish all of this, so the first thing we did was to simplify our app to make an MVP in 3 days.
After a few pivots, we decided to focus on creating a concert venue rating system were a user can review venues.

**Technologies Used**

- Ruby/ Ruby on Rails

**What I would like to do next**

- A user can write a review/comment on a particular venue.
- A user can few the average rating of a particular venue.
- A user can create a wishlist of upcoming shows/artists in the future.
- A user can few all of the past concerts that they went to.
- A user can have a profile page, where it tracks the places that they went.
- A user can upload images/videos of the concert.
- A user can view the location of the venue using the google maps api.
