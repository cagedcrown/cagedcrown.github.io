## Overview
For week nine of the Web Development Immersive course, we were all told to write an idea for a group project that we would like to do.
Then we were split into groups of 4 and told to pick one of our classmates ideas that were not our own.

## Original Idea
Use an API that a user will be able to see local concerts (U St. Music Hall, Lincoln Theater, etc.) and create a list of shows they're interested in.
Then integrating a music API a user will also be able to listen to the performing artists most popular songs without being rerouted to another site.

## Our Version
VenuMenu is a web app that allows users to search venues by name or location. The data is pulled from the Songkick API. Once a user searches a venue VenuMenu provides results including the name, address, telephone number and a link to the venue website. The web app allows the user to sign in/up with twitter which opens up new features.

**Technologies Used**

- Ruby/ Ruby on Rails
- Javascript
- Songkick API
- Mapbox API
- PostgreSQL Database
- ActiveRecord
- Heroku
- HTML & CSS
- Adobe Photoshop CC
- Adobe AfterEffects CC

**User Stories Completed**

- User can sign up / sign in with Twitter
- User can search for a venue by name

**What I would like to do next**

- A user can write a review/comment on a particular venue.
- A user can few the average rating of a particular venue.
- A user can create a wishlist of upcoming shows/artists in the future.
- A user can few all of the past concerts that they went to.
- A user can have a profile page, where it tracks the places that they went.
- A user can upload images/videos of the concert.
- A user can view the location of the venue using the google maps api.
